# Othello

Othello is a strategy board game played on an 8x8 board with 64 discs. Each disc is black on one side and white on the other. The goal is to have the majority of discs showing your color at the end of the game.

2. **Players and Turns**:
   - The game is played between two players. One player uses black discs and the other uses white discs.
   - Black always moves first.
   - Players take turns placing one disc on the board with their color facing up.

3. **Valid Moves**:
   - A valid move must capture one or more of the opponent's discs.
   - To capture, the player's disc must outflank one or more of the opponent's discs in a straight line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
   - The outflanked discs are flipped to the player's color.

4. **Making a Move**:
   - Place a disc on an empty square that outflanks one or more of the opponent's discs.
   - Flip all outflanked opponent discs to your color.

5. **Passing a Turn**:
   - If a player cannot make a valid move, they must pass their turn.
   - If neither player can move, the game ends.

6. **End of the Game**:
   - The game ends when neither player can make a valid move or the board is full.
   - Count the discs to determine the winner. The player with the most discs of their color wins. <br>

## Additional Notes
- If the game ends in a tie (both players have the same number of discs), the game is a draw.
- Strategic placement and flipping can change the game's outcome dramatically, making every move critical.
